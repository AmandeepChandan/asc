<h1>Hey, I'm Amandeep. Average 18 year old highschool student. </h1>
<p>I'm graduating soon, and tinkering around in web design and graphic design.<br> Web design and graphic design are both interesting and fun to do, and I'd like to do more of this in the future. <br> My plans after high school is most likely community college, before transfering off to a 4 year university.<br> I'd also like to see about internships and what not, they'd be nice for the experience and the skill set that they could provide. I do have certifications in photoshop and illustrator under my metaphorical belt. <br><br>
If you'd like to contact me: <span class ="email">deep3775@gmail.com</span>
